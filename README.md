# Youtube-chapter-keyboard-navigation

This userscript combines some of the code from [youtubeChapterRewind](https://github.com/miyliyevr/youtubeChapterRewind) and
[youtube-forward-timeline](https://github.com/cawa-93/youtube-forward-timeline) with some additional functionality to allow its user to navigate between Youtube's Video chapters with the keyboard by pressing `p` to rewind or skip to a previous chapter (double tap) or 'n' to skip forward.
